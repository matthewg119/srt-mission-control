// FTC 16 CFR Part 465 and the Rytr fact pattern: a tool that GENERATES review content its

// not. Every rule below follows from staying well behind that line.

// Pure and isomorphic on purpose, the same doctrine as src/lib/clients/normalize.ts: the
// client component previews the assembly as she types and the server stores from this same
// function, so what she reads and what is kept cannot drift.
